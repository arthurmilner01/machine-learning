    "    - Interestingly, the polynomial kernel found a C of 100 to be most appropriate. This is perhaps due to the fact the degree the grid search had returned was 3, meaning the decision boundary can be a little more flexible and potentially requires a bit of a bigger margin to maintain the margin/misclassification trade-off. It is also worth noting when I allowed a degree of 1 in the grid search it would choose this degree, meaning it would essentially be acting as a linear kernel and suggests the polynomial kernel is not a good fit for the problem because the data is somewhat linearly separable before applying the kernel trick of translating to a higher degree.\n",

    "    - The ideal gamma value chosen by the grid search for RBF was 0.001, which can be considered a very low value for gamma, meaning the kernel is considering points both close and very far away in the creation of its decision boundary. This suggests that the ideal decision boundary will be somewhat straight, which also further explains why the linear kernel performs so well on the dataset, contrary to my predictions."

    "After utilising grid search with a wide range of values and comparing their results I think the optimal kernel for this dataset would be, to my surprise, the linear kernel. The precision, recall and f1-score of the linear kernel outperform both the RBF and polynomial kernels in every category. It is because of this I believe the linear kernel to perhaps be the optimal kernel for the problem as it has the lowest computational cost and training speed and delivers consistently better results than the polynomial and RBF kernel with the tested parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the scores of the kernels against the test and train data, it is clear the polynomial kernel suffers from overfitting to a much higher degree than the other two, which appear to have a somewhat even performance between train and test scores. The polynomial generally has an f1-score over 20 points higher on the train than the test, a clear indicator of overfitting a model onto the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a more in-depth look at the general scores of the three kernels you can see predicting a positive outcome is considerably less accurate than predicting a negative one. Generally all three kernels manage an f1-score of at least 79 for predicting a negative outcome, where as predicting a positive outcome the f1-score can go into the low 50s for the polynomial kernel and mid 60s for RBF/linear kernel. To consider the real world this is perhaps because diabetes can be heavily influenced by genetics, such as type 2 diabetes being linked to family history which is not measured within the dataset.\n",

A potential cause of this severe overfitting could be the fact that predicting a negative is generally a lot easier to predict than a positive using the dataset, this has also been the case for all 3 models I have trained thus far. Consequently, some weak learners may actually perform well on predicting the negative cases which could harm AdaBoost's effectiveness.

Consequently, it would not be unfair to state it performs better on the given dataset in classifying unseen data accurately. Both the models performance, however, is somewhat unimpressive as they both get around 80 for all 3 performance metrics of precision, recall and f1-score. Interesting to note is the Random Forest suffers severely from overfitting, its scores on the training data come in at around a very acceptable 90 but drop to the 70s on the test data. If I managed to reduce this overfitting its very possible the Random Forest would outperform the SVM so it is a shame I was unable to do so.\n",

    "It could be valid to say that the SVM model is capturing more of a macro perspective on the problem whilst the Random Forest is capturing more of a micro perspective by overfitting on the training data.\n",

    "<strong>Tuning Process of Both Models:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit you might consider of the SVM model was that the linear kernel only requires one parameter to be tuned, consequently its much easier to realise the optimal performance of that model, on the other hand, Random Forest has many parameters which have an effect on model performance meaning it can be a lot more of an exhaustive search for the optimal parameters. Another perspective here however could be that the many parameters of Random Forest makes it a much more adaptive algorithm for different datasets, of course, the many kernels for SVM means it also has this adaptivity but for linear kernel it can be considered somewhat constricted. It is worth noting even when using polynomial or RBF kernel for SVM it has much less important parameters you must tune for performance improvement compared to Random Forest.\n",

    "<strong>Advantages of SVM:</strong>\n",
    "- The model is very versatile and can work well with a lot of datasets.\n",
    "- Relatively simple model to understand.\n",
    "- Easy to tune due to the small number of important parameters.\n",
    "- Linear SVM is fast to train, especially compared to other kernel options.\n",
    "- SVM can handle many dimensions of data relatively well depending on the kernel. (For high dimensions RBF generally considered)\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Disadvantages of SVM:</strong>\n",
    "- Struggles with large datasets for reasons such as the time complexity.\n",
    "- Sensitive to noise within the dataset. (Such as in the diabetes dataset where positive and negative outcomes often overlap.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Advantages of Random Forest:</strong>\n",
    "- There are ways to measure how effective each feature is in improving the overall impurity in the forest, meaning you can effectively dispose of irrelevant features and helping in feature selection.\n",
    "- The model is very versatile and can work well with a lot of datasets.\n",
    "- Relatively simple model to understand.\n",
    "- Can work for both classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Disadvantages of Random Forest:</strong>\n",
    "- If the model requires a lot of estimators to be effective, it can become ineffective for real time classification due to the time complexity.\n",
    "- With the diabetes dataset it appears to suffer from overfitting, perhaps this can be overcome with better feature selection.\n",
    "- Sensitive to noise within the dataset.\n",

    "<strong>Conclusion:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude both models have their uses, many of these uses overlap, such as they are both often used to gain a better insight into the data rather than as a final model. In this case the SVM outperformed the Random Forest and should theroretically perform faster due to it using the linear kernel. That being said, Random Forest was perhaps focusing on the noise in the dataset, so with some further pre-processing it could very well outperform the SVM. Something such as making sure there were even rows of negative and positive outcomes could be an example of further pre-processing."
